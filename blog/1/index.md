# Hey there!
Welcome to the first ever blog post on this website.

## What is today's blog post about?
In this blog post I'd like to speak about a really strange moment I've had with my [Compaq](https://lolzoes.com/mypcs/compaqpresariosr5000) when trying to film a video and I'd like to speak about my projects for this month.

## Strange moments
When I was trying to install Windows XP on my computer, I got a message. Now I know this is most likely because of a corrupted ISO file, but however it's still strange and it's a message that I haven't seen before and I'd like to share it with you.

This is the image:

![Windows XP EULA Error](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lolzoes/Lolzoes/refs/heads/main/assets/Windows%20XP%20EULA%20error.jpg). 

## Projects for this month
This month I'd like to:

- Install an SSD in the Compaq.
- Make a video on Windows Vienna (a fan-made version of Windows Vista) - this is in the works and will be released soon.
- Running Windows 11 on older hardware, this would most likely be done on the Compaq.
